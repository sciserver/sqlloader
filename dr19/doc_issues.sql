INSERT DBObjects VALUES('dbo.dr19_panstarrs1','U','U',' A copy of the PanSTARRS1-dr2 catalogue provided by E. Magnier. Based on the internal IPP database representation mainyaned by IfA, U. Hawaii. Column names may differ from publically available catalogues hosted at MAST (mapping provided in column descriptions). The SDSS-V copy of this database is derived from a combination of the PS1-dr2 StackObjectThin and ObjectThin tables (https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/PS1+Database+object+and+detection+tables). The catalogue contains PSF, Kron, and Aper measurements based on stacked and forced warp photometry, and expressed as fluxes, including measurements are made of low-significance detections. The average exposure (chip) measurements are expressed in magnitudes since photometry is not measured at this stage for sources with S/N < 5, so there should not be any negative fluxes. Magnitudes are on the AB system, fluxes are in Janskys. Conversion to AB mags is via: mag = 8.9 - 2.5*log10(flux). ','','0');

When multiple sdss_ids are associated with the same catalogid, the one with the lowest rank (rank=1) should be preferred.

This process is repeated for a number of all-sky catalogues. See <a href=''https://sdss.org/dr19/targeting/fps/sky/''> for further details of the process by which suitable sky locations are selected in SDSS-V/FPS.
