<h2> Overview</h2>
                                The loading framework for the CAS databases 
 is  in  the   <b>sqlLoader</b>         CVS module. &nbsp;There are several 
 subdirectories      at the top level   as   listed   below. &nbsp;All but 
 the <b>admin</b>   subdirectory   are to be  deployed   on  the <b>loadserver</b> 
 machine.<br>
                                                           
<ol>
                                <li><b>admin</b> - contains the loader admin
  web   interface      (Load    Monitor) files. &nbsp;The   contents of this
  subdirectory   should      be copied    to the web tree which will   serve
  as the loader   web page.    &nbsp;This  needs    to be on a Windows web
 server.</li>
                                <li><b>doc</b> - contains the documentation 
 files    for   the   loader,     including   this file.</li>
                                <li><b>dts</b> - contains the DTS (Data Transformation
       Services)      packages    used by the loader.</li>
                                <li><b>htm</b> - contains the stored procedures 
   and   DLL   (dynamically       linked  library) for the HTM (Hierarchical 
   Triangular    Mesh).<br>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>loadadmin</b> - contains the back
end   of  the       <b>admin</b>       web   front  end, i.e., all the files
and   scripts   that implement the  CAS    loader.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li><b>schema</b> - contains the schema input 
  (<i>.sql</i>)        files    for   the CAS databases.</li>
                                <li><b>vbs</b> - contains Visual Basic scripts
   (<i>.vbs</i>       files)    used   by the loader.</li>
                                                           
</ol>
                              Each of these directories has a <b>readme</b> 
 file   to  describe     the   directory    contents. &nbsp;The prominent 
subdirectories     are described     in  further detail    below.<br>
                                                       
<ol>
                                                                 
</ol>
                                                       
<h2><a name="Admin"></a>Load Monitor or Admin Webpage (admin/ subdir)</h2>
                            The <b>admin</b> subdirectory contains the web
 pages    and   associated      files   and scripts for the loader administration
  web  interface   (the <b>Load     Monitor</b>).  &nbsp;This subdirectory
  should  be copied   or moved to the    web tree where the load monitor
is   to be accessed  from.   &nbsp;<u>Note  that    currently the admin web
pages   must be installed  on   a Windows machine  (running    IIS) since
they use   ASP (active server  pages)   technology.</u>  &nbsp;The  security
  setup   is Windows authentication  at   the moment and this  <u>requires
 that the    pages be accessed also from  a  Windows machine</u>.  &nbsp;The
web-server      connects  to the loadsupport    DB of the loadserver.<br>
                            <br>
                            There are 4 kinds of files in this directory: 
                              
<ol>
                                <li> Active Server Pages (<i>.asp</i> files)
  that   correspond      to  actual   web pages.</li>
                              <li>Cascading Style Sheets (<i>.css</i> files)
  that   are   used   by  the   web  pages to set up the look and feel.</li>
                              <li>Javascript (<i>.js</i>) files that contain
  functions      in  jscript     to  perform loader admin procedures.</li>
                              <li>Include (<i>.inc</i>) files that are included 
   in  other    files    above.</li>
                                                           
</ol>
                            There is a <b>docs.asp</b> file that contains 
an  overview     of  the   loading     process and framework. &nbsp;It is 
the  page linked    to the  "Help"   link on   the admin page. &nbsp;The <b>img</b>
 subdirectory      contains  the  JPG and GIF   images used in the web pages.<br>
                            <br>
                            In order to set up the admin web pages for the
 SQL   Loader,     you   need   to  do  the following:<br>
                                                       
<ol>
                              <li>Copy/move the <b>admin</b> subdirectory 
of  sqlLoader      to  the   web   tree  where the admin pages will be served
  from.</li>
                              <li>Set up a virtual directory in IIS to point
  to  this   directory.<br>
                              </li>
                              <li>Modify the <b>connection.js</b> file (edit
  with   Notepad)     to         replace the xxx-ed out password for the
    <b>webagent</b>     user          with the real password.<br>
                       </li>
                                                       
</ol>
                                                                
<h2><a name="Loadadmin"></a>Loader Admin Framework (loadadmin/ subdir)</h2>
                            The <b>loadadmin</b> subdirectory is where all
 the   action    is  -  it  contains    all the scripts that actually load
 the data  and update    the  logs.  &nbsp;There    are 2 kinds of files
here:<br>
                                                       
<ol>
                              <li>Windows command scripts (<i>.bat</i> files) 
  that   run   the   loading     framework  and SQL scripts.</li>
                              <li>SQL scripts (<i>.sql</i> files) that contain
   the   SQL   code   to  set   up  the loading framework and load the data.</li>
                                                       
</ol>
                            There are two parts to the loading framework: 
<b>loadadmin</b>         and   <b>loadsupport</b>.    &nbsp;The loadadmin 
scripts and databases      control    the load framework on  the  <i>master</i>. 
&nbsp;The loadsupport      scripts   and DBs set up the loading  on the <i>slave</i> 
loadservers  and    build the   ancillary framework to facilitate  the loading 
process,  such   as setting up  the webagent user, setting up links  between 
master  and slave    loadservers   (if applicable), setting up the HTM,  and
utilities    to manage    units of the  loading process (phase, step, task
etc.). &nbsp;See    <a href="fig1.jpg">Fig.1</a>  which shows the relationship 
between the LoadAdmin       and LoadSupport parts  of the framework. &nbsp;Each 
of the satellite   or   slave  servers links only  to the master, not to each
other. &nbsp;The   loadsupport     part of the loading  works only with remote
<i>views</i>   of the loader  tables. &nbsp;<br>
                     
<h3><i>Load</i> and <i>Publish</i> Roles<br>
           </h3>
           The loadadmin and loadsupport servers also have different roles
 in  the   current  &nbsp;distributed implementation: &nbsp;the loadadmin
server  runs   both in  <i>load</i> and <i>publish</i> roles, whereas the
loadsupport  servers   run  only in the <i>load</i> role. &nbsp;The load
role corresponds  to the   loading  of the CSV files into the individual
component databases  (one per   load unit),  whereas the publish role involves
the validation and transfer   of the component  database contents into the
publish DB for each dataset.   &nbsp;The loading  is therefore done in parallel,
and the publishing brings   all the loaded components  together into the
publish DB on the master server.<a href="#Loadadmin"><img src="fig1.jpg"

<h3>Loader Command Scripts</h3>
                                                       
<ol>
                              <li><b>build-loadadmin.bat</b> - This builds
 the   loadadmin      framework      on  the master server. &nbsp;This is
to be  run     <u>only  once</u>    from the    command  line on the main
(master)  loadserver  machine.  &nbsp;It    takes no    parameters.  &nbsp;It
performs  the following  tasks:</li>
                                                                        
                                      
  <ul>
                                <li>gets the loadserver computer name</li>
                                <li>creates the path for the loader logs</li>

  must   be  run on each of the loadservers in the configuration, including
  the master.    &nbsp;It builds the loadsupport     part   of  the framework
  on the current    loadserver (which can be the master     or one  of  the
  slaves if applicable),    including the <b>loadsupport database</b>,  
     the  HTM, loadsupport  utilities  etc. &nbsp;<u>Note that the <b>set-loadsupport.bat</b>

<h3>Task Management</h3>
                            This section describes the way tasks are handled
  in  the   loader    framework.     &nbsp;The basic unit of loading at the
  top  level   is a <b>task</b>.    &nbsp;Tasks     are further divided into
  <b>steps</b>,    which are in turn   subdivided into    <b>phases</b>.
&nbsp;Steps   have a  well-defined <i>start</i>   and <i>end</i>,    whereas
a phase does   not have  a start or end associated   with it. &nbsp;A   step
also has a  stored procedure  associated with it.  The tasks display ("Active
 Tasks"  or "All Tasks") shows  the taskid, the stepid and the phaseid, hence
 the  granularity of the task  display is a single phase.               
           
<h3>Creating a New Task</h3>
                       The <a href="newTask.htm">New Task</a> link creates
 a  new   loading     task.     You can select the following parameters of
 the  task:                         
<ol>
                         <li><b>dataset</b> - select between TEST, DR1, DR1C
  or  DR2;    this   is  the    release that the loading is being done for,
  with  TEST  being  used   for    testing.</li>
                         <li><b>export type</b> - the database that this
is  being    exported     to:   BEST,   RUNS of TARGET for an imaging load, 
PLATES  for    spectro, TILES    for   tiling,   and a special target FINISH 
for the last    step that ties  up  all  the loose   ends in publishing a 
complete  CAS.</li>
                         <li><b>xroot</b> - this is the root of the exported
  CSV   directory      tree   on   the LINUX side (Samba-mounted), in Windows
  notation     (\\<i>hostname</i>\<i>directory</i>\<i>subdir</i>...).</li>
                        <li><b>xid</b> - the identifier of this load unit,
 i.e.   the   chunk,    plates   or   tiles that need to be loaded.  This
is basically    the name  of  the   subdirectory  in the <a
 href="csvDir.htm">CSV directory    tree</a>  that    contains the runs,
 plates or tiles that are to be loaded.</li>
                         <li><b>user</b> - the username of the person who 
is  running     this   load     task. </li>
                         <li><b>comment</b> - an optional comment to describe 
  the   purpose     or  content    of this load.</li>
                                             
</ol>
                                               
<h3>Killing a Task</h3>
                        If you are sure something is wrong with a task and
 want   to  kill   it,   you   can do so by clicking on the last column of
 the task   display   in the   tasks   table.  You will be prompted for confirmation.
     The loader   cleans   up when   a task is killed, but some files and
especially    temp DBs  created   will not   be deleted until the same task
(with the  same  parameters   but of  course a  different taskID) is run
again.<br>

<h2><a name="Setup"></a>Setting Up SQL Loader Framework</h2>
                            To summarize, the following steps must be performed 
   to  set   up and install the sqlLoader so that data can be loaded into 
the   databases.      &nbsp;Most of these steps (#1-9) are things that you 
should   typically  only   have to do <u>once</u>, the first   time you set 
up the   loader. &nbsp;   <u>If   the loadserver has already been configured, 
proceed   directly to step  10.<br>
                    </u>                             
<ol>
                           <li>Make sure that the SQL Server security on
the   master    loadserver   (loadadmin)    machine  is <b>mixed     security</b>,
  i.e.  not  Windows Only.    This is necessary   for  the webagent     user
  to be  able  to connect to  the loadadmin server. &nbsp;To check and change 
  the security,  bring up Enterprise   Manager, select the local SQL Server 
  group, and go to the Tools menu and  select "SQL Server Configuration Properties...". 
  &nbsp;Go  to the Security  screen and make sure that "SQL Server and Windows" 
  authentication  is selected  instead of "Windows Only".</li>
                            <li>Make sure that the SQL Server Agent is running
   on  the   master    loadserver  (loadadmin)       </li>
                                                                        
           
  <ul>
                                                                        
                                              
    <ul>
                                                                        
                                                          
    </ul>
                                                                        
              
  </ul>
                        <li>On the master <i>loadserver</i> machine, check
 out   a  copy   of  the         <b>sqlLoader</b> module in the C:\ drive.</li>
                <li>Make sure that the <b>tempDB</b> properties are set correctly.
     &nbsp;In   Enterprise Manager under the Databases tab, select tempDB
and    then select   Taskpad from the View menu. &nbsp;This will show the
DB properties     at a galance.  &nbsp;You need to check/set the following:</li>
                                                       
  <ul>
                  <li>The data file for the DB <u>on the D: drive</u> needs 
 to  be  set  to grow automatically. &nbsp;To set this:</li>
                                                                        
          
    <ul>
                    <li>Move the mouse over the little yellow Database button 
  at  the   top  and select Database Properties. &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Once the window comes up, select the Data Files tab.</li>
                  <li>Click on the data file entry for the D: drive (d:\sql_db\...).<br>
                  </li>
                    <li>Click on the "Automatically grow file" button to
check    it  (turn   it on) if it isn't checked already.</li>
                    <li>Click on the "By Percent" button below it and enter 
 25  in  the   value window. &nbsp;The growth should be at least 10%, preferably 
   25%  for   best performance.</li>
                                                                        
          
    </ul>
                  <li>Make sure that the data file for the DB <u>on the C:
 drive</u>      is <u>not</u> set to grow automatically. &nbsp;To set this:</li>
                                                                       
    <ul>
                  <li>In the Data Files tab, click on the data file entry 
for   the   C:  drive (c:\sql_db\...).<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Click on the "Automatically grow file" button to&nbsp;
  turn    it  OFF, <u>only</u> if it <u>is</u> checked.</li>
                                                                       
    </ul>
                <li>The size of the data file should be at least 10GB (10000MB),
    preferably    20GB (20000MB) if there is room to spare. &nbsp;You can
only    increase the    size of the data files from the initial size (you
cannot   decrease the size    below the initial size the DB was created with).
&nbsp;To   increase the size,</li>
                                                                        
          
    <ul>
                    <li>Click on the name of the data file name (probably 
D:\sql_db\tempdb_data*.mdf,       or .ndf) - this will be the largest file. 
&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Click on the Size column for that file, and enter 
the   new   size   in MD (10000 or 20000). &nbsp;</li>
                                                                        
          
    </ul>
                                                   
  </ul>
                Once you are done, press the Ok button at the bottom to apply 
  the   changes.   &nbsp;It will take a while to increase the size of the 
data  file   (few minutes   to half hour).                       <li>Set up
the  load monitor  web interface   on a Windows  machine    (web  server 
running  IIS):</li>

  from.</li>
                                <li>Set up a virtual directory in IIS to
point    to  this   directory.<br>
                                </li>
                                <li>Modify the <b>connection.js</b> file
(edit    with   Notepad)     in  the   admin directory to replace the xxx-ed
out  password    for the       <b>webagent</b>        user with the real

                           <li>Run the following scripts from a command shell 
  (Start-&gt;Run...-&gt;cmd).    &nbsp;Note that step 4 should be run on each
  loadserver in the configuration    (including the master), each of which
 will have the sqlLoader directory  shared.</li>
                                                                        
                          
  <ol>
                     <li><b>C:</b><br>
                Make sure you are on the C: drive.     </li>
                     <li><b>cd C:\sqlLoader\loadadmin</b><br>
                  Go to the loadadmin subdirectory in the loader.     </li>
                       <li><b>build-loadadmin.bat</b><br>
                     	This will create the loadadmin environment and DB.</li>

            	       <b>build-loadsupport.bat -L</b> (on each loadserver/slave 
  other    than master)<br>
                     	Run this on each loadserver in the configuration. &nbsp;On
    all   but the master (loadadmin) server, the sqlLoader directory is shared.
    &nbsp;This   will create the loadsupport environment and DB and set this
            loadserver's   role to both LOAD and PUBLISH. &nbsp;If the last
  message   from running the  above 2 steps says "Access denied..." rather
 than "1 file(s)   moved", this  means that the log file could not be moved
 to the loadlog directory.   &nbsp;You  will need to right-click on the C:\loadlog
    directory, select Properties   or Sharing and Security and go to the
Sharing     tab. &nbsp;In the Sharing permissions   screen, select Everyone
and turn    on Full Control. &nbsp;After doing this,   you will have to restart
the  setup   at step 9 above.&nbsp;</li>
                          <li>For a BEST and TARGET load (public datasets) run
                     the command:<dd><b>build-publish-db.bat &lt;<i>dataset</i>&gt;
    	&lt;<i>db-data-size</i>&gt;       &lt;<i>db-logsize</i>&gt;</b><br>
			For RUNS loading, run the following command:<dd><b>build-runs-db.bat &lt;<i>dataset</i>&gt;
    	&lt;<i>db-data-size</i>&gt;       &lt;<i>db-logsize</i>&gt;</b><br>
                      	These scripts should be run on the master
                     only. &nbsp;The build-publish-dbs.bat script 
  will   automatically create publish DBs for the BEST and TARGET  skyversions
     for each dataset.  &nbsp;This will take some time  	to   run for  multi-GB
     sizes. &nbsp;The sizes you pick for the DB and log  	files   should
 be   approximately:<br>
                      	   <dd><b>&lt;<i>db-data-size</i>&gt;</b> = the total
  size   of  the    data  (CSV         files) that you want to load + 50%,
         <u>in MB</u>.    	    </dd>
                          <dd><b>&lt;<i>db-log-size</i>&gt;</b> = at least
 50%   of  the   CSV   data           size, <u>in MB</u>. e.g.,<br>
                            <br>
                     	   </dd>
                          <dd><b>build-publish-db.bat TEST 20000 10000</b>
                     (for BEST/TARGET loader)<br>
                          <dd><b>build-runs-db.bat TEST 20000 10000</b>
                     (for RUNS loader)<br>
                            <br>
                     	These are just the initial sizes - SQL Server will
expand    the   file   	sizes   as needed, but this comes at a performance
cost so   it's better  	to  allocate   enough space to begin with.  Note that
there are analogous scripts for BEST and TARGET DBs as for RUNS:
build-best-db.bat and build-target-db.bat, but you should not need to run them
separately.</dd>

<h2><a name="Run"></a>Running the Loader</h2>
                            The loading is launched and controlled from the 
 <a href="#Admin">Load Monitor web interface</a>.   &nbsp;A  New Task must 
 be         created and launched for each unit of the loading,   whether 
it is   an   imaging,   spectro or tiling load. &nbsp;The unit for each 
 type of    loading   as as  follows:<br>
                                                       
<ul>
                              <li>imaging - a <b>chunk</b>, as resolved by
 OpDB,    and   corresponding        to  a subdirectory under $chunkRoot/inchunk_*/,
    e.g.   stripe35_mu629735_1.</li>
                              <li>spectro - a <b>spectro run</b>, i.e. a
sequence     of  plates    that   is  considered to be part of the current
load because     it  corresponds    to the  imaging  unit last loaded (as
listed in the  corresponding        <b>spPlatesToLoad*.par</b>        file).
&nbsp;In the      <a href="csvDir.htm">CSV directory tree</a>, there    
is   separate subdirectory    under spCSV/plates/ for each such run. &nbsp;The
    name   of the directory    is constructed from the date+time (e.g., 2003-01-28-1800) 
       of the  spectro  run to avoid collision with a different run that may
 be   processed    in  the same timeframe.</li>
                              <li>tiling - a <b>tileRun</b>, e.g. chunk15.<br>
                              </li>

 href="files.htm">Files</a> or <a href="log.htm">Log</a> links to look at
           the steps, files and phases logged (completed) for that task.

<p> The PRELOAD step of a loading task usually takes the longest time, as 
           the CSV files are loaded into the load-DB in this step.  The largest 
      of   the  CSV files for each run - the PhotoObj*.csv files - each will 
   take   10-15   mins  each to load, and the preload step for one imaging 
 chunk  can   take more  than  an hour to complete.  You can monitor the progress
   of the   preload step  by  selecting the <a href="files.htm">Files</a> 
display    for   that task.   </p>

<h3><a name="Run"></a>Running FINISH step by step manually</h3>
Currently the FINISH part of the loading can be run step by step, but only if
manually invoked from the SQL QA or SQL Agent.
<p>
The command to execute shd be:
<dd>EXEC spFinishStep &lt;taskid&gt, &lt;stepid&gt;[, &lt;step&gt;[, &lt;mode&gt; ] ]
<p>
(both &lt;step&gt; and &lt;mode&gt; are optional)
<p>
where &lt;taskid&gt; = 1, 2 or 3 for BEST, TARG or RUNS resp.,
<dd>      &lt;stepid&gt; = 1,
<dd>      &lt;step&gt; = one of the following:
<dd><dd>	        'ALL', (default)
<dd><dd>		'dropIndices',
<dd><dd>		'syncSchema',
<dd><dd>		'loadPhotoTag',
<dd><dd>		'buildPrimaryKeys',
<dd><dd>		'buildIndices',
<dd><dd>		'buildForeignKeys',
<dd><dd>		'computeNeighbors',
<dd><dd>		'buildMatchTables',
<dd><dd>		'regionsSectorsWedges',
<dd><dd>		'loadScienceTables',
<dd><dd>		'syncSpectro',
<dd><dd>		'buildFinishIndices',
<dd><dd>		'matchTargetBest',
<dd><dd>		'loadPatches'
<dd>      &lt;mode&gt; = 'resume' (default) or some other string (not 'resume')
<p>
The resume mode means keep going with the FINISH step after executing the
first step indicated, otherwise it stops after that step.
<p>
So in most cases, you will be using something like:
<p>
<dd>     EXEC spFinishStep 1, 1, 'buildIndices'
<p>
whereas
<p>
<dd>     EXEC spFinishStep 1, 1
<p>
is equivalent to:
<p>
<dd>     EXEC spFinishStep 1, 1, 'ALL', 'resume'
<p>
(don't bother to specify the 4th parameter because you want resume mode).

                                                
<h2><a name="Weblog"></a>The WebLog DB</h2>
          The WebLog database maintains a record of every query submitted 
to  the   DB  server via the SkyServer web interface. &nbsp;All skyserver 
queries  are  submitted  to the server through the execution of the spExecuteSQL
 stored    procedure.  &nbsp; However, the task of getting the query information
 from    the web server  to the DB server is non-trivial (because Active
Directory     is not set up),  and ensuring its success requires that the
following steps    be performed.<br>
                   
<ol>
            <li>Set up the web logging configuration in the IIS running on
 the   web   server:</li>
                                       
  <ul>
              <li>Right-click on My Computer and select Manage</li>
              <li>Open the "Services and Applications" tab</li>
              <li>Open the "Internet Information Services" (IIS) tab</li>
              <li>Select the "Default Web Site" and right-click on it. &nbsp;Select
     Properties.</li>
              <li>Go to the Web Site screen</li>
              <li>Make sure that "Enable Logging" is checked<br>
              </li>
              <li>In the "Active Log Format" window, make sure that "W3C
Extended     Log File Format" is selected (not "ODBC logging")</li>
              <li>Click on Properties next to the log format window</li>
              <li>Select Daily logging</li>
              <li>Set the log file directory to %WinDir%\System32\LogFiles</li>
              <li>Open the "Extended Properties" tab, and select the following
   items   to be logged:</li>
                                                           
    <ul>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>Time</li>
                <li>Client IP Address</li>
                <li>User Name</li>
                <li>Server IP Address</li>
                <li>Server Port</li>

                <li>URI Query</li>
                <li>Protocol Status</li>
                <li>User Agent</li>
                                                           
    </ul>
                                       
  </ul>
            <li>Once a month, move all the files in the LogFiles folder to
 a  new   folder  to save them.</li>
            <li>On the DB server, open Enterprise Manager (EM). &nbsp;The 
SQL   logging   is driven off of the existence of the WebLog DB. &nbsp;A check
 for the existence   of this DB is built into the spExecuteSQL stored procedure.
  &nbsp;This procedure   inserts the query submitted by the user into the
Weblog  tables. &nbsp; The   tables in the WebLog DB are:</li>
                                       
  <ul>
              <li>The WebLog..WebLog table is the DTS (Data Tranformation 
Services)     copy of the web logs from the web server. &nbsp;</li>
              <li>The WebLog..TrafficBase keeps the yearly, monthly, daily
 distillation     of the logs, i.e. the traffic on the webserver.</li>
              <li>The WebLog tables SqlStatementLog and SqlPerformanceLog 
get   populated   by spExecuteSQL.</li>
                                       
  </ul>
            <li>The SQL Agent should have one job to merge new weblogs. &nbsp;The 
    job should be in the DB Maintenance category. &nbsp;To create this job, 
  the procedure is as follows:<br>
                                             
    <ol>
             <li> Open the Management tab in EM</li>
             <li>Open the SQL Server Agent tab under Management</li>
             <li>Right-click on Jobs and select New Job ...</li>
             <li>Type in a name for the job, e.g., "Merge in new weblogs"</li>
             <li>Make sure Enabled is checked</li>
             <li>Select Database Maintenance in the Category window</li>
             <li>Make the local DB admin the owner of the task</li>
             <li>Type in a description, e.g. "Copies last 2 days of logs
into   skyserver  weblog database"</li>
             <li>Next, open the Steps tab and select New... to create a new 
 step</li>
             <li>Type in a name for the step, e.g. "Do the merge"</li>
             <li>Select WebLog as the database in the Database window</li>
             <li>In the Command window, type in "EXEC WebLogMerge"</li>
             <li>Open the Advanced tab within Steps and make sure that the
 On  Success  action is "Quit the job reporting success", and On Failure
action   is "Quit  the job reporting failure"; click Ok to return to main
Steps screen<br>
             </li>
             <li>Open the Schedules tab and select New Schedule... to create
  a  new schedule</li>
             <li>Select Recurring, and create a Daily schedule to run the 
job   every  hour from 1 am until 11:59:59pm.</li>
             <li>Save all changes by selecting Ok on all screens. &nbsp;The 
 job   should appear in the Jobs display now.<br>
             </li>
                                             
    </ol>
        This job invokes the WebLogMerge procedure, which appends the weblog
  from  the last 2 days each time. &nbsp;This in turn calls UpdateWebLog,
which  is  where all the work is really done. &nbsp;Both these procedures
are in  sqlLoader/schema/log/webLogDBCreate.sql,  which is also where the
WebLog DB creation code is. &nbsp;The way the weblog  appending is done is:</li>
                                       
  <ul>
              <li>The webserver weblog directory is remote-mounted on the 
DB  server</li>
              <li>We manually delete the last 2 days of logs before moving
 the   new   ones in</li>
              <li>This is scheduled (in the SQL Agent job scheduling) to
happen    every  hour on the hour.</li>
              <li>The notification is sent to the Windows Applications Log
 if  it  fails</li>
              <li>The DTS script that transfers the weblog from the webserver 
  to  the  DB server is in sqlLoader/schema/log/bcpWebLog.js (JavaScript). 
 &nbsp;This   calls the xcopyWebLogFromYesterday.js script that is also in 
 the same directory.</li>
                                       
  </ul>
                   
</ol>
          To Do: <br>
                   
<ol>
            <li>Put the webserver side of weblogging config in the installation 
   scripts/procedures.</li>
            <li>Schedule task(s) to clean up weblog directory on webserver
 every    so  often. &nbsp;Currently this has to be done manually.<br>
            </li>
                   
</ol>
                                           
<h2><a name="DocTables"></a>Updating Metadata and Documentation Tables</h2>

 The <i>schema/csv</i> subdirectory contains the files that load
 the content for the associated metadata tables.  The files  are all SQL
 scripts that can be run in the SQL QA.  However, it is not  necessary to run
 them manually, since the <b>spLoadMetaData</b> procedure in the BEST
 database can be invoked to run them all.   This section lists the files 
 and the steps necessary to load or update the metadata into the BEST DB.

 <h3>Metadata Loading Scripts </h3>
 The metadata tables in the BEST database and their corresponding loading
 scripts and purpose are listed in the table below.  The loading scripts are
 generated (by the Visual Basic scripts in <i>vbs</i> subdirectory)
 from the schema (.sql) files in the <i>schema/sql</i> subdirectory. <br>
 <table border=1>
    <tr><td>DB Table</td> <td>Loading script (in <i>schema/csv</i>)</td> <td>Purpose/content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><b>DBObjects</b></td> <td><b>loaddbobjects.sql</b></td> <td>Name and description of every user Table, View, Function and Stored Procedure in the database. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><b>DBColumns</b></td> <td><b>loaddbcolumns.sql</b></td> <td>Name and description of every Column in every user Table in the database. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><b>DBViewCols</b></td> <td><b>loaddbviewcols.sql</b></td> <td>Name and descriptio of every Column in every user View in the database. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><b>Dependency</b></td> <td><b>loaddependency.sql</b></td> <td>The dependency chart for functions and procedures that gives the parent and child names for each such object. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><b>Inventory</b></td> <td><b>loadinventory.sql</b></td> <td>A list of every schema object ordered by the file that contains it. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><b>History</b></td> <td><b>loadhistory.sql</b></td> <td>Extracts the change history from each schema file and shows them in chronological order.</td>
    </tr>
 </table> 
<h3>Documentation Files</h3>
The documentation tables <b>Glossary</b>, <b>Algorithm</b> and
 <b>TableDesc</b> in the BEST database hold the content for the Glossary,
 Algorithms and Table Description pages in the SkyServer Help
 menu. &nbsp;These pages are auto-generated from these tables on the
 fly.  To modify the content of these Help pages, you need to make the changes
 in the original context .txt files in the <i>schema/doc</i> subdirectory.
<p>
The mappings between the SkyServer Help pages, the corresponding DB tables,
 the content files and loading scripts are shown in the table below.
           
<table border=1>
 <tr><td>SkyServer Help Page</td> <td>DB Table</td> <td>Content file (in <i>schema/doc</i>)</td> <td>Loading script (in <i>schema/csv</i>)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr><td><b>Glossary</b></td> <td><b>Glossary</b></td> <td><b>glossary.txt</b></td> <td><b>loadglossary.sql</b></td>

</table>
	
</ul> 

<h3>Loading Metadata and Documentation into BEST DB</h3>
The following steps are necessary in order to load or update these metadata and
documentation tables:<br>
(<b>NOTE</b>: If you are running the spSyncSchema stored procedure,
you do not need to execute the following steps because spSyncSchema
runs all of them after running the schema synchronization scripts.)
           
<ol>
        <li>Run a command shell (Start-&gt;Run-(cmd)) on the host that has
       the sqlLoader installed (loadadmin server).<br>
       </li>
       <li>In the <i>sqlLoader/vbs</i> directory, run the <b>runAll.bat</b> 
       script and it will generate each of the .sql files listed above 
       into the <i>schema/csv</i> subdirectory. 
       </li>
       <li>Open a SQL Query Analyzer in the BEST database for that release
        (e.g. BESTDR3) and run the following command:<p>
	<dd> EXEC spLoadMetaData 0,0,'C:\sqlLoader\schema\csv\'
	<p> where the first 2 parameters (taskid,stepid) are set to 0, and
        C:\sqlLoader is the location of the sqlLoader directory in
        which the runAll.bat script was run in step 2.  <u>Remember the last
        '\' at the end of the sqlLoader path, otherwise it won't work.</u><br>
	</li>
</ol>
                 
<h2><a name="WebInterface"></a>Setting Up SkyServer Web Interface</h2>
                             The <b>SkyServer</b> web pages   can be pointed 
 to the newly published databases as follows:    
<ol>
      <li><b>Create the web interface directory on the webserver</b> - On 
the webserver machine that is running IIS, install the SkyServer web tree 
under the C:\skyserver directory.   
There will be one copy of the web interface for each access type that this
webserver serves. &nbsp;There are 3 types of access possible:</li>
           
  <ul>
       <li><b>collab</b> - this is restricted access for the SDSS collaboration 
 only; &nbsp;it is a no-frills interface that connects to private SDSS data.<br>
       </li>
       <li><b>astro</b> - public access to public data, but with a no-frills 
 interface that includes educational content.<br>
       </li>
       <li><b>public</b> - public access to public data with all the educational 
 and public information content and fancy interface.<br>
       </li>
           
  </ul>
   The web tree for each type of access is identical, but one file is modified 
 at the top level to set the site parameters and access level (see step 2). 
 &nbsp; The SkyServer web tree is in the CVS <b>skyServer</b> product.  Check
 the desired (tagged) version of the skyServer product out of CVS as follows:
<p>
<dd> > cvs co -r &lt;tag&gt; skyServer
<p>
This will check out the version tagged with the given tag into the directory.
<u>This needs to be a tagged <i>checkout</i> rather than an <i>export</i></u>
so that changes from CVS can be applied to each web tree using the CVS update
command, e.g., 
<p>
<dd> > cd C:\skyserver\collab.dr3
<dd> > cvs up -r v3_5
<p>
in order to make bug fixes and other updates.  Rename the newly created
"skyServer" sub-directory under C:\skyserver according to the convention
"&lt;access-type&gt;.&lt;release&gt;", e.g. C:\skyserver\collab.dr3\, or
C:\skyserver\public.dr3\, etc., so that it is easy to tell the function and
release date of a particular skyserver site. &nbsp;The virtual directory (URL)
for the collaboration CAS should be pointed to the
C:\skyserver\collab.&lt;release&gt; directory (i.e., the&nbsp;
C:\skyServer\collab.dr3 directory in the above example), and similarly the
public site should be pointed to the C:\skyServer\public.&lt;release&gt;
directory. &nbsp; A similar convention should be followed for an astro site if
necessary.

<li><b>Set up the site parameters in the <u>globals.inc</u>
 file</b> - To point the skyserver website to the correct database server
and set up all the other parameters like the access level etc., you  need
to modify a single file at the top level of the web interface directory that
 you created in step 1 - the globals.inc include file.  Note that the CVS
 export of skyServer will contain a <b>globals.inc.cvs</b> file - <u>do not
 modify this file, it is just the template for globals.inc that is checked
 into CVS.</u>  Copy the file to a new file called globals.inc (no
 .cvs extension).  &nbsp;Open this file in NotePad or your favorite
 editor. &nbsp;There are comments (instructions) in the file that describe
 what needs to be set. &nbsp;This includes the following  parameters:<br>
      </li>
            
  <ol>
      <li><b>Access level</b> - the <i>access</i> variable controls the site
 look and feel, the timeouts, and the content that is displayed for different
 classes of users.</li>
      <li><b>Release</b> - The name of this release, e.g. DR1, DR2 etc. is
 stored in the <i>release</i> variable. &nbsp;This is used in page titles,
 default database name (BESTDR1, TARGDR2) as stored in the <i>database</i>
 variable (next line in file, <u>you don't need to change this</u>).<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Connection to the database server</b> - Set the <i>userid</i>,
       <i>userpwd</i>, and <i>server</i> variables to control the access
to  the database server. The userid is "test" for the web user that accesses
the database. &nbsp;The userid and password are usually set xxx-ed out in
CVS for security purposes.  Replace the x's by the correct userid and password
 for the web user. Also on the next line, set the server name to&nbsp; the
 name of the machine that the  databases reside on.</li>
      <li><b>Set the URLs for educational services and tools</b> - the rest
 of the file contains URL settings for various tools and services. &nbsp;The
       <i>astroCAS</i> and <i>collabCAS</i> URLs are the links to the corresponding
 CAS for the current release. &nbsp;The <i>wsGetJpegurl</i> and <i>wdCutOut</i>
 URLs are for the image cutout service.<br>
      </li>
       
  </ol>
              <li><b>Create a virtual directory if necessary</b> - Next you
 need to create a virtual directory corresponding to the URL  that will point
 to this site, if it doesn't already exist. &nbsp;Usually,  the collab site
 URL is the "collab" virtual directory under the default web  site (e.g.
http://skyserver2.fnal.gov/collab/),  similarly for the public and astro
sites. &nbsp;If the virtual directory corresponding to the URL already exists,
just make sure it points to the correct Windows directory (e.g. C:\skyserver\collab.02-25-2004).
&nbsp;[To set up or check a virtual directory, right-click on "My Computer"
 and select "Manage". &nbsp;Open the Services and Applications tab and then
 the Internet Information Services (IIS) tab. &nbsp;Then open the Default
Web Site tab. &nbsp;If "collab" or "public" doesnt exist under it, right-click
 on Default Web Site and select New Virtual Directory. &nbsp;Create the new
 Virtual directory and set C:\skyServer\collab (or public) as its home directory.
 &nbsp;If the collab or public virtual directory already exists, right-click
 on it and view its Properties, &nbsp;and make sure its home directory is
set to the correct one.]</li>
  <li><b>Update the SiteConstants table</b> - Part of the SiteConstants table
is updated automatically, but the WebServerURL and DataServerURL values should
be updated to reflect the CAS and DAS URLs that this DB server is linked
to. &nbsp;The underlying assumption here is that each DB server is serving
a unique SkyServer site, which is not always true. &nbsp;In case the DB server
is serving more than one SkyServer site, you can just set the WebServerURL
to one of them - the most stable one. &nbsp;Remember to include the "en/"
at the end of the CAS URL. &nbsp;These URLs are used by functions like fGetUrlNavExp
and fGetUrlFits... to build URLs for image cutouts and FITs files &nbsp;(on
the DAS). &nbsp;The URLs can be updated with commands like:</li>
 <blockquote>
    UPDATE SiteConstants SET
        value='http://skyserver2.fnal.gov/dr2/en/' 
	WHERE name='WebServerURL'<br>
    UPDATE SiteConstants SET value='http://das.sdss.org/dr2/data/' 
	WHERE name='DataServerURL'
 </blockquote>
    <li><b>Set up web access user on DB server</b> - If the DB server is
new  or the databases have been copied to it from somewhere else, you will
need  to set up the web access user on it ("test" user). &nbsp;Open a Query
Analyzer  window (on master or BEST DB) on the DB server. &nbsp;Enter the
following  commands in the QA window (first command only necessary if no
login exists  for "test", you can check in Security-&gt;Logins):</li>
   
</ol>
   
<blockquote>      
  <blockquote>EXEC sp_addlogin 'test', '&lt;pwd&gt;', 'master'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {&lt;pwd&gt; = test's password}<br>
  USE BEST&lt;release&gt;<br>
  EXEC sp_change_users_login N'UPDATE_ONE', N'test', N'test'<br>
  EXEC spGrantAccess 'U', 'test'<br>
  USE TARG&lt;release&gt;<br>
  EXEC sp_change_users_login N'UPDATE_ONE', N'test', N'test'<br>
  EXEC spGrantAccess 'U', 'test'<br>
 USE master<br>
 GRANT EXECUTE ON [dbo].xp_varbintohexstr to test<br>
       </blockquote>
  This should set up the web access (and take care of orphaned users if you
 copied the DB from elsewhere).<br>
</blockquote>
     
<ol>
       
</ol>
    To switch the database server that a particular skyserver site points 
to,  perform step 2.3 to edit the globals.inc file and set the server name.<br>

on the network (or at least  the       <b>mssql</b>   user which the   loadserver

                           <li><u>The CHK step log displays a WARNING status
  for   the   zoom   files       indicating that the number of zoom files

  <ul>
                            <li>Some or all the zoom files for one or more
 camCols     may   be       missing.  Sometimes the fpC* (corrected frame)
 files for   some       fields    are legitimately missing.  However in this
 case there   need       to be links    instead to zoom files from a different
 run or      skyVersion.     A more serious   problem may be that the zooms
 did not        get genrated     from the FITS fpC   files because of an
error  in the        fits2jpeg code    or the pipeline code   that runs it.
 This  can be       due to a problem  (such   as corruption) with   the source
FITS       files.</li>
                            <li>If this warning in the CHK step is ignored, 
 eventually      the        loader will stop with an error in the PRELOAD 
step (in the  File         Load  phase).  While this may seem harsh, making 
the loader      tolerant      to missing  zoom files would be dangerous because 
 real      problems such     as corruption  in the FITS files could go   
  undetected,   and frames  with    missing zooms  would get loaded.</li>

 &nbsp;You      may need to stop and restart the LOAD or PUB job (depending

                            <li>If the loading is stalled after the file
load   phase,    this   may        still be due to a problem with loading
one of   the files,    because        sometimes the problem manifests itself 
in a  later phase.      </li>

  <ul>
                            <li>This is actually a special case of the previous 
   problem,     but        is more insidious and serious so deserves separate 
   mention.   The       problem will manifest itself as a WARNING during the
   loading of        the    relevant file, and the message will indicate that
   the number       of lines    in the file, i.e., the <i>expected</i> number
   of rows,      is different   (almost always <i>more</i>) than the    
  <i>actual</i>         number  of rows loaded.       </li>
                             <li>Debugging a corruption problem is not easy,
  especially      if  it       occurs (as it almost always does) in the largest
  PhotoObjAll      CSV       files.  The first step in such cases is to look
  in the CSV      generation    logs (log files written by the sqlFits2Csv
 code) for      warnings or errors.     Next you can narrow the problem to
 a      specific     run within the stripe    in which it occurs, by querying
      the temporary     load DB for the number    of lines (SELECT count(*)
       FROM PhotoObjAll     WHERE run=xxx) and comparing    the count with
 the       number of lines    in the corresponding CSV files.    After that,
 you      can measure the  length   of PhotoObjAll lines in the  CSV files
 for       that run by counting  the   commas on each line with a PERL  script.</li>
